ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rohan Wadadar, an aspiring software developer and MCA candidate with a BSc in Computer Science (Hons). I have a passion for building innovative and user-friendly web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and more.

ðŸ’» I'm currently working on a variety of projects, from event listing websites to e-commerce platforms, with a focus on clean code and responsive design. I'm also exploring emerging fields like blockchain and security systems to expand my skill set.

ðŸ”§ I'm always looking to refine my skills and collaborate on exciting projects. Whether it's creating smooth animations, developing complex backend systems, or crafting intuitive user interfaces, I enjoy tackling challenges head-on.

ðŸ“š Outside of coding, I'm a cricketer, and I balance my time between studies, sports, and continuous learning. I'm also keen on exploring new opportunities in software development, and I'm currently seeking internships where I can contribute and grow.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and let's connect if you're interested in collaborating or discussing tech!
